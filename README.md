# joes-hotdgs

You are creating a simple order system for Joe’s Hotdgs.  Joe’s has only 4 items:  hotdogs, fries, soda and sauerkraut.  The cost of the items is $4, $3.50, $1.50, $1 respectively.  You need to do the following:
- Present the order choices to the user
- Get the order quantities desired for each item 
- Calculate the order total
- Display the order plus the total

The order system needs to be implemented 4 ways:
1.	Using an associative array of items and prices ( index-a.html )
2.	Using a simple object format ( i.e. { }) ( index-so.html )
3.	Using a function object (index-fo.html )
4.	Using a class ( index-c.html )
In each case, take full advantage of the specific construct you are using.
Note that each implementation should be in a different html file.
